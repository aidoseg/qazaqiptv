## How to watch?

The most easy way to download playlist and open it in [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/)

But better use special IPTV apps such as [OTT Player](https://ottplayer.tv/soft), [IPTVnator](https://github.com/4gray/iptvnator/releases). My own choice is [My IPTV Player](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/myiptv-player/9PJJ2NMBF0TR?hl=en-us&gl=US) for Windows and [TiviMate](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ar.tvplayer.tv) for Android TV.
